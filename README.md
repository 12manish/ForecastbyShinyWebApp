# ForecastbyShinyWebApp
### Built by R Shiny
This ShinyApp can be used as a forecasting tool to test when a specific smoothing forecasting technique should be implemented in any time sereis data.In this tool Seven models are embeded,The first part present the summary of data which show the mean,meadion, mode. We can either upload own data  inside the R . Then the user should choose the column of data frame that contains the data requiring analysis. The frequency of data and the beginning/ending periods of both fitting sample and hold out sample can be set afterward.Then we can compare different forecasting techniques by switching to different time series algorithm panels. We can creat our own training and testing set in the data summary panel by ourself.In case anyone  want to upload their own data set, the suggested form of data frame is that time in the first column and observation in the second column. then the app will definitely work.
